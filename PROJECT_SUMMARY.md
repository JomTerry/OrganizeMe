# OrganizeMe - Complete Project Documentation

## üì± App Overview

**OrganizeMe** is a lightweight Android task management app designed specifically for IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme) students. The app helps students like Mr. Mivan organize their tasks, track deadlines, and prioritize their workload effectively.

### Core Problem
IBDP students juggle numerous assignments, projects, and deadlines across multiple subjects, often forgetting tasks or struggling to prioritize what to do next.

### MVP Solution
A simple, offline-first Android app that allows students to:
- Quickly add tasks with deadlines and importance levels
- Automatically sort tasks by priority and urgency
- Receive timely notifications for upcoming deadlines
- Mark tasks as complete with satisfying interactions
- Toggle between priority-based and date-based views

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Kivy + KivyMD for native Android UI
- **Backend**: Python for application logic
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Notifications**: Plyer for cross-platform notifications
- **Build**: Buildozer for Android APK generation

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Offline-First**: All data stored locally for instant access and privacy
2. **Material Design**: Following Material Design 3 principles for familiar UX
3. **Automatic Sorting**: Intelligent task prioritization based on deadline and importance
4. **Minimal Setup**: No account creation or complex configuration required

## üìã MVP Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Essential Features Delivered:**
1. **Add Task**: Name, optional description, due date, importance (High/Medium/Low), optional reminder
2. **Auto-Sort**: Tasks grouped under High, Medium, Low priority based on deadline and chosen importance
3. **Mark Done**: Tap to complete a task and move it out of main list
4. **Reminders**: Optional notifications at user-chosen times
5. **Offline-First**: Everything stored locally in SQLite
6. **Simple UI**: One screen to add tasks, one screen to view them by priority
7. **View Toggle**: Switch between priority view and date view
