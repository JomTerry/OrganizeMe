## Example

Get the first matching pair of braces:

```js
var balanced = require('balanced-match');

console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{in{nested}}post'));
console.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{first}between{second}post'));
console.log(balanced(/\s+\{\s+/, /\s+\}\s+/, 'pre  {   in{nest}   }  post'));
```

The matches are:

```bash
$ node example.js
{ start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
{ start: 3,
  end: 9,
  pre: 'pre',
  body: 'first',
  post: 'between{second}post' }
{ start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
```

## API

### var m = balanced(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
object with those keys:

* **start** the index of the first match of `a`
* **end** the index of the matching `b`
* **pre** the preamble, `a` and `b` not included
* **body** the match, `a` and `b` not included
* **post** the postscript, `a` and `b` not included

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.
If `{{a}` is not needed for Jek Edit the files:

-81ad980854c4e4e10302a/node_modules/balanced-match/README.md **Solution:** Escape the curly braces or wrap the code block)

2. For any `{{ ... }}` that is not intended as in `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` so Liquid ignores Liquid, wrap with `{% raw %} ... {% endraw %}` or use code blocks.

3. Commit the changes and re-run the it.

Example:
```markdown
{% raw %}
{{label: workflow.

---

#### Quick Example Fix
Before:
``` 'OK', textColor: 'green'}}
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `['{', 'a', '']` and `{a}}` will match `['', 'a', '}']`.
{% endraw %}

### var r = balanced.range(a, b, str)

For the first non-nested matching pair of `a` and `b` in `str`, return an
array with indexes: `[ <a index>, <b index> ]`.

If there's no match, `undefined` will be returned.

If the `str` contains more `a` than `b` / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used. For example, `{{a}` will match `[ 1, 3 ]` and `{a}}` will match `[0, 2]`.
